# Bayesian Bootstrap

Kinetic measurements may result in a small set of high-variance data. Such data are not readily amenable to standard uncertainty analysis. The Bayesian bootstrap provides a credibility region to the true mean value that is not biased toward small values and is logically more consistent with the given type of data.

**Example**<br />
The example directory contains 5 sample data files with arbitrary time values (column 1) and example rate constants that span many orders of magnitude (column 2).  The python script performs a 10,000-fold Bayesian bootstrap of the 5 different rate constants at any time point and writes to an output file the average rate constant and the minimum and maximum values of a 95% credibility region.
